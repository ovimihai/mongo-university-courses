# Indexes

## Introduction

## How data is stored on disk

Storage Engines
- WiredTiger - Default 
    - starting 3.2
    - document-level concurrency model
    - write-ahead journaling (snappy compressed)  & checkpointing - for durability
    - supports compression for collections and indexes (snappy)
    - memory use (internal cache) max of:
        - 50% of (RAM - 1GB)
        - 256 MB
    - each connection uses up to 1MB of RAM
    - `db.collection.stats()` - `wiredTiger.block-manager.file` unused space - clean with `compact` command
- In-Memory
- MMAPv1 - deprecated in 4.0
    - original storage engine
    - journal - operations are set durrably on disk
    - records stored contiguosly on disk - in time can create fragmentation
    - allocate space before needed (power of 2, document padding)
    - uses all machine memory as its cache

Print stats for each database
```js
db.adminCommand("listDatabases").databases.forEach(function (d) {
   mdb = db.getSiblingDB(d.name);
   printjson(mdb.stats());
})
```

Print stats for each collection in each database
```js
db.adminCommand("listDatabases").databases.forEach(function (d) {
   mdb = db.getSiblingDB(d.name);
   mdb.getCollectionNames().forEach(function(c) {
      s = mdb[c].stats();
      printjson(s);
   })
})
```

### WireTiger storage
- files
    - default
        - collection-{no}--{id}.wt
        - index-{no}--{id}.wt
    - `--directoryperdb` - puts each collection and index file into a folder
    - `--directoryperdb --wiredTigerDirectoryForIndexes`
        - creates directory structure db/collections/ and db/index - good for IO paralalization (symlinks to different drives)
- by default data is written to ram then compressed on disk - for persistency
    - compressed on disk = less IO but more CPU
    - done by write concern or by checkpointing from time to time
- journaling - usefull for data recovery
    - flushes in journal files periodically
    - can require j:true in the app to confirm that the data was written to the journal

## Single Field Indexes
- [simplest index](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/index-single/)
- features
    - create on one field
    - can find single value
    - can find a range of values ($gt, $lt)
    - can create on subdocument (dot notation. subdocument.subfield)
    - can be used to find several distinct values ($in list)
- `db.collection.createIndex({<field>: <direction>})`
- `db.collection.find(<query>).explain("executionStats")`

## Explain
- find out what happened
    - used expected index?
    - used index for sorting?
    - used to return a projection?
    - is it selective enough?
    - what part of the plan is the most expensive?
- create explainable object - doesn't actually run the query
    ```js
    exp = db.collection.explain()
    exp.find(<query>)
    ```
- COLLSCAN - scanned all collection
- IXSCAN - index scan
- nReturn - number of fields returned
- totalKeysExamined - index keys read (preferably as close to the nReturned as possible)
- totalDocsExamined - documents read (preferably as close to the totalKeysExamined as possible)
- executionTime
- execution params:
    - `queryPlanner` - default param - doesn't execute the query
    - `executionStats` - return more statistics, (!) executes the query
    - `allPlansExecution` - the most verbose param, (!) executes the query
- winningPlans - the best execution plan
- rejectedPlans: list of slower plans
- SORT_KEY_GENERATOR - in memory sort, no index for sorting
    - memoryUsage
    - memoryLimit - max 32MB, if more sorting will be canceled
        - document size * number of documents should be less than this for a query
- `mongos` sends the query to each shard then gatheres the results
- SHARD_MERGE
- MongoDB Compass for better index view

## Sorting with Indexes
- sorting in memory
    - documents are stored dandomly
    - store documents in RAM
    - apply a sorting algorithm
    - abort sorting over 32MB
- sorting with indexes
    - indexes can be used for filtering or sorting
    - forward or backward
    - example:
        - query all documents and sort by no index key
            - COLLSCAN -> SORT_KEY_GENERATOR -> SORT (in memory)
        - query all documents and sort by WITH index key
            - IXSCAN used for sorting

## Compound Indexes
- creates a list with all combinations of the selected fields
- the index is like a sorted list

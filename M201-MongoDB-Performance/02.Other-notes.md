# Some other notes

## How data is stored on disk

Storage Engines
- WiredTiger - Default 
    - starting 3.2
    - document-level concurrency model
    - write-ahead journaling (snappy compressed)  & checkpointing - for durability
    - supports compression for collections and indexes (snappy)
    - memory use (internal cache) max of:
        - 50% of (RAM - 1GB)
        - 256 MB
    - each connection uses up to 1MB of RAM
    - `db.collection.stats()` - `wiredTiger.block-manager.file` unused space - clean with `compact` command
- In-Memory
- MMAPv1 - deprecated in 4.0
    - original storage engine
    - journal - operations are set durrably on disk
    - records stored contiguosly on disk - in time can create fragmentation
    - allocate space before needed (power of 2, document padding)
    - uses all machine memory as its cache

Print stats for each database
```js
db.adminCommand("listDatabases").databases.forEach(function (d) {
   mdb = db.getSiblingDB(d.name);
   printjson(mdb.stats());
})
```

Print stats for each collection in each database
```js
db.adminCommand("listDatabases").databases.forEach(function (d) {
   mdb = db.getSiblingDB(d.name);
   mdb.getCollectionNames().forEach(function(c) {
      s = mdb[c].stats();
      printjson(s);
   })
})
```

### WireTiger storage
- files
    - default
        - collection-{no}--{id}.wt
        - index-{no}--{id}.wt
    - `--directoryperdb` - puts each collection and index file into a folder
    - `--directoryperdb --wiredTigerDirectoryForIndexes`
        - creates directory structure db/collections/ and db/index - good for IO paralalization (symlinks to different drives)
- by default data is written to ram then compressed on disk - for persistency
    - compressed on disk = less IO but more CPU
    - done by write concern or by checkpointing from time to time
- journaling - usefull for data recovery
    - flushes in journal files periodically
    - can require j:true in the app to confirm that the data was written to the journal




- MongoDB sorting in memory changed in 4.4 from 32MB to 100MB
- Mongo Compass interface issue when creating index (v1.38.0)
    - when you write the first part of the field then select the name it doesn't actually work ok

- Can use index prefix for sort +filter
- Index prefix will work forward and backward

- MongoDB 4.2 - hybrid indexes
